- Added proper TypeScript types for form data and component props
- Improved type safety in component communication
- Changes made to:
  - `pages/admin/episodes/new.vue`:
    - Added explicit import for EpisodeForm component
    - Added proper Episode interface typing
    - Improved handleSubmit function type safety
  - `components/EpisodeForm.vue`:
    - Added proper typing for form data
    - Improved emit definitions
    - Ensured consistent data structure with Episode interface

- Add preview capability for episodes

### Database Schema Update (2024-12-14 13:04 PST)
#### Added Episode and Podcast Types
- Added proper TypeScript types for Episodes and Podcasts in `types/supabase.ts`
- Schema includes:
  - Episodes:
    - Basic info: title, description, slug
    - Media: audio_url, video_url, transcript
    - Metadata: duration, published_at, status
    - Access control: is_premium
    - Relations: podcast_id
  - Podcasts:
    - Basic info: title, description, slug
    - Media: cover_image_url
    - External links: rss_feed_url, website_url
    - Metadata: status
    - Relations: author_id

#### Next Steps for Database Integration
1. Verify Supabase table structure matches our TypeScript types
2. Add necessary foreign key constraints:
   - episodes.podcast_id -> podcasts.id
   - podcasts.author_id -> auth.users.id
3. Add database indexes for common queries:
   - episodes(podcast_id, created_at)
   - podcasts(author_id, status)
4. Set up Row Level Security (RLS) policies:
   - Podcasts: only authors can create/edit
   - Episodes: only podcast authors can create/edit

#### Current Issues
- Episode creation not persisting to database
- Need to verify Supabase table structure
- Need to implement proper error handling for database operations

### Database Policy Fix (2024-12-14 13:06 PST)
#### Added Row Level Security (RLS) Policies for Episodes
- Added missing RLS policies in `02_policies.sql`:
  - Insert policy: Podcast authors can create episodes
  - Update policy: Podcast authors can update episodes
  - Delete policy: Podcast authors can delete episodes
- Each policy verifies that the authenticated user is the author of the podcast

#### Issue Resolution
The episode creation issue was caused by missing RLS policies. The database schema was correct, but Supabase's RLS was blocking the insert operations because no policy explicitly allowed episode creation.

#### Next Steps
1. Apply the new migration to add the episode policies
2. Test episode creation workflow:
   - Create a podcast as an authenticated user
   - Add episodes to the podcast
   - Verify proper access control
3. Consider adding additional policies for:
   - Batch operations on episodes
   - Episode status transitions
   - Premium content management

### Database Migration Strategy (2024-12-14 13:09 PST)
#### Migration Order and Process
For reproducibility and to avoid conflicts, migrations should be run in this order:
1. `00_drop_all.sql`: Resets the database by dropping all objects
   - Disables triggers
   - Drops policies
   - Drops tables
   - Drops functions
   - Drops types
2. `01_schema.sql`: Creates the database schema
   - Creates enum types
   - Creates tables with relationships
   - Enables RLS on all tables
3. `02_policies.sql`: Sets up Row Level Security policies
   - Defines access policies for all tables
   - Includes new episode management policies
4. `03_setup_admin.sql`: Configures initial admin setup

#### Current Changes to Apply
- Added episode management policies in `02_policies.sql`:
  ```sql
  create policy "Podcast authors can create episodes"
    on public.episodes for insert
    with check (
        exists (
            select 1 from public.podcasts
            where id = podcast_id
            and author_id = auth.uid()
        )
    );
  ```
  Plus similar policies for update and delete operations.

#### Steps to Apply Changes
1. Reset database using `00_drop_all.sql`
2. Apply schema with `01_schema.sql`
3. Apply all policies with `02_policies.sql`
4. Set up admin with `03_setup_admin.sql`
5. Verify episode creation workflow

This ensures a clean, reproducible state and avoids any conflicts from incremental changes.

### Admin Form Improvements (2025-03-17 17:00 PST)
#### Fixed Form Data Loading Issues
- Fixed blank form issues when editing existing content:
  - `pages/admin/episodes/[episodeId].vue`: Updated prop from `:episode` to `:initial-data`
  - `pages/admin/podcasts/[id].vue`: Updated prop from `:podcast` to `:initial-data`

#### Technical Implementation
- Aligned form component prop names with their expected APIs
- Verified data flow from Supabase through to form components
- Ensured proper TypeScript types for form data

#### Build Verification
- Ran `npm run build` locally before committing changes
- Build passed successfully with no errors
- Verified changes in development environment
- Committed only after successful local build

#### Technical Decisions
1. Form Component Props:
   - Changed to use `:initial-data` consistently across forms
   - Chosen to match existing component API design
   - Improves code consistency and maintainability
   - Reduces potential for similar bugs in future forms

#### Known Issues
- No remaining issues with admin form data loading
- All builds passing successfully

#### Next Steps
- Continue implementing content analytics features
- Add listener statistics tracking
- Implement engagement metrics
- Create download reports functionality

## Latest Updates (2024-12-14)

### Episode Management Improvements

### Type System and Component Updates

#### Changes Made
1. Updated component imports to use Nuxt composables:
   - Modified `AuthLoginModal.vue`, `AuthSignupModal.vue`, `AuthTest.vue`, and `TheHeader.vue` to use `#imports` for Supabase
   - Replaced direct imports from `@supabase/supabase-js` with Nuxt's built-in composables
   - Updated router imports to use `#app` instead of `vue-router`

2. Form Components Type Updates:
   - Updated `PodcastForm.vue` with proper type definitions matching database schema
   - Updated `EpisodeForm.vue` with correct form data structure
   - Simplified form submission logic across components

3. Authentication Components:
   - Standardized user state management using `useSupabaseUser` composable
   - Improved error handling in auth-related components
   - Unified loading state management across components

#### Technical Decisions
- Decided to use Nuxt's auto-imports system for better integration with the framework
- Standardized the approach to user state management using Nuxt Supabase module composables
- Simplified component logic by removing duplicate code and unnecessary complexity

#### Known Issues
- Build process showing some TypeScript errors related to imports
- Some components may need further updates to handle proper type definitions
- Potential duplicate imports from Pinia that need to be addressed

#### Next Steps
1. Resolve remaining TypeScript errors in the build process
2. Test all authentication flows with updated components
3. Update remaining components to use proper Nuxt composables
4. Add proper error boundaries and loading states
5. Document the new type system and component patterns

### Twitter Audio Card Integration Investigation

#### Attempted Approach
- Tried implementing Twitter Player Card for audio episodes
- Added required meta tags including twitter:player, twitter:player:stream, etc.
- Added twitter:site meta tag and other required fields
- Used absolute URLs for player and audio sources

#### Findings
- Twitter Player Card does not fully support audio-only content
- While documentation mentions "audio" alongside video, all examples and implementation details focus on video players
- Major audio platforms (SoundCloud, Spotify) use Summary Cards with Large Image instead of Player Cards
- Twitter's policy states "Player Cards are reserved for linear audio and video consumption only" but practical implementation appears to be video-focused

#### Recommendation
Use Summary Card with Large Image (twitter:card="summary_large_image") for audio episodes instead of attempting to implement a player card. This is the approach used by major audio platforms and is more reliable.

### TypeScript and Deployment Improvements
#### Fixed TypeScript Build Errors
- Resolved TypeScript errors in podcast and episode creation components
- Added proper type definitions for database entities in `types/database.ts`
- Added Nuxt-Supabase type declarations in `types/nuxt-supabase.d.ts`
- Updated interfaces to match Supabase schema:
  - Fixed nullable fields in `PodcastFormData` interface
  - Corrected status type to use proper enum values
  - Added proper typing for user authentication using `useSupabaseUser`

#### Deployment Configuration
- Successfully deployed to Netlify with TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Build process now completes without TypeScript errors
- Remaining warnings are only related to duplicate Pinia imports (non-critical)

#### Next Steps
- Monitor Netlify deployment for any runtime issues
- Consider addressing duplicate Pinia imports if they cause performance issues
- Continue maintaining strict TypeScript compliance for new features

## Update
- Updated pre-commit hook for Husky v10.0.0 compatibility
- Removed deprecated configuration lines
- Maintained all functionality including build checks and bypass option

## Session Updates

### February 15, 2025 - 14:00 PST
#### Completed:
- Reviewed and organized project TODOs
- Added comprehensive testing, documentation, and performance optimization tasks
- Reorganized Twitter Card Integration tasks with clear priorities
- Updated technical.md with detailed next steps for Twitter Card implementation

#### Next Steps:
1. Domain and SSL Setup (Highest Priority)
   - Register a permanent domain name
   - Configure DNS settings
   - Set up SSL certificate for the domain
   - Update Netlify deployment with custom domain

2. Twitter Developer Platform Setup
   - Create Twitter Developer account at developer.twitter.com
   - Create Project and App in developer portal
   - Request elevated access for Player Card functionality
   - Set up API credentials

These are critical path items that must be completed before we can proceed with Twitter Card implementation. The domain needs to be secured with HTTPS before Twitter will whitelist it for Player Card functionality.

## Admin Setup

### Setting Up Admin User
After applying migrations, you need to set up an admin user. This is a two-step process:

1. First, get your user ID:
```sql
select id from auth.users where email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

2. Then run the setup_admin.sql script (located in `supabase/functions/setup_admin.sql`):
   - Open the script
   - Replace 'YOUR-USER-ID-HERE' with your actual user ID
   - Run the entire script in the Supabase SQL editor

The script will:
- Create the admin role if it doesn't exist
- Assign the admin role to your user
- Set up an institutional subscription
- Handle any conflicts (won't create duplicates)

### Verification
After running the script, verify the setup:
```sql
-- Check user roles
select * from public.user_roles where user_id = 'your-user-id';

-- Check subscription
select * from public.user_subscriptions where user_id = 'your-user-id';
```

## Supabase CLI Setup

### Initial Setup
1. Install Supabase CLI:
```bash
brew install supabase/tap/supabase
```

2. Login to Supabase:
```bash
supabase login
```

### Project Connection
1. Get your project reference ID from the Supabase dashboard (Settings > API)
2. Link your project:
```bash
cd catechize
supabase link --project-ref <project-ref>
# Example: supabase link --project-ref ujbqmocqaptppxxgsufo
```

### Database Connection
The database password can be found in:
- Supabase Dashboard > Project Settings > Database > Connection Info > Database Password
- Store this securely and never commit it to version control

### Common Issues
1. If you get authentication errors:
   - Check if you're logged in: `supabase status`
   - Re-login if needed: `supabase login`

2. If migrations fail:
   - Verify project reference ID
   - Ensure you're in the correct directory (should be in `catechize`)
   - Check migration file naming (must follow pattern: `<timestamp>_name.sql`)

## Database Migration Management

### Migration File Structure
- `20231214131800_reset.sql` - Drops application tables
- `20231214131900_schema.sql` - Creates schema and tables
- `20231214134700_all_policies.sql` - Sets up all RLS policies

### Full Database Reset Procedure
Due to limitations in the Supabase CLI, to perform a full database reset:

1. List all migrations:
```bash
supabase migration list
```

2. Revert migrations in reverse chronological order:
```bash
supabase migration repair --status reverted <latest_migration>
supabase migration repair --status reverted <second_latest_migration>
supabase migration repair --status reverted <earliest_migration>
```

3. Push all migrations again:
```bash
supabase db push
```

This method ensures clean migration state and proper reapplication of schema and policies.
