### Status Indicators
> Status Legend:
> - ✓ Completed: Task is finished and working as expected
> - ⚡ In Progress: Currently being worked on
> - ⏳ Pending: Planned but not started
> - ❌ Cancelled: Not possible or no longer needed

#### Cancelled Features Policy
When a feature is determined to be impossible, impractical, or no longer needed:
1. Keep the feature in documentation with ❌ Cancelled status
2. Include clear explanation of why it was cancelled
3. Add reference links to relevant documentation
4. Record the date when the decision was made

Example:
```markdown
- [ ] Feature Name (❌ Cancelled):
  - [ ] Sub-feature (Not possible due to technical limitation)
  - [ ] Sub-feature (Cancelled: incompatible with current architecture)
  Date: 2025-03-18
  Reference: [Technical Documentation](path/to/docs)
```

This ensures we maintain historical context and don't attempt to implement cancelled features in the future.
