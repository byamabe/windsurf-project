### Homepage Real Data Integration (2025-01-25 11:38 PST)
#### Changes Made
- Updated homepage (`pages/index.vue`) to use real data from Supabase:
  - Featured Podcasts now shows actual published podcasts
  - Latest Episodes displays real episodes sorted by creation date
  - Both sections limited to 5 items each
- Modified `ContentRow` component to handle real data:
  - Added support for `cover_image_url` from real data
  - Maintained backward compatibility with mock data `thumbnail`
  - Added fallback to dynamic placeholder images
- Kept other sections (Loci, Authors, Questions) as mock data for future implementation

#### Data Flow
- Homepage now uses `usePodcast` and `useEpisode` composables to fetch data
- Podcasts and episodes are filtered by `status === 'published'`
- Episodes are sorted by `created_at` timestamp

#### Next Steps
- Implement real data for remaining sections (Loci, Authors, Questions)
- Add loading states for data fetching
- Consider implementing pagination or infinite scroll for "View All" pages
- Add error handling UI for failed data fetches

### TypeScript Fixes for Homepage Components (2025-01-25 11:40 PST)
#### Changes Made

  - Updated `ContentRow` component props interface:
    - Made `thumbnail` optional
    - Made `description` nullable
    - Added proper typing for `cover_image_url`
  - Modified data transformation in `index.vue`:
    - Added explicit mapping for podcast data
    - Added explicit mapping for episode data
    - Ensured all required fields are present
- Note: Episodes currently don't have cover images. Consider:
  - Using parent podcast's cover image
  - Adding dedicated episode thumbnails
  - Using generated placeholders

#### Next Steps
- Add episode thumbnail/cover image functionality
- Consider adding loading states while data is being fetched
- Implement error handling UI for failed data fetches

  - Separated data storage from display data using different refs
  - Maintained type safety throughout the data transformation pipeline
- Updated `index.vue`:
  - Added `displayPodcasts` and `displayEpisodes` refs for UI
  - Keep original data in `featuredPodcasts` and `latestEpisodes`
  - Added proper type annotations for all refs
- Benefits:
  - Clear separation between data and display layers
  - Type-safe transformations
  - Easier to modify display format without affecting data structure

#### Next Steps

  - Changed from simple subquery to inner join for accurate counting
  - Modified data transformation to handle new query response format

#### Technical Details
- Previous query was using a simple subquery which didn't properly filter episodes by podcast
- New query uses `episodes!inner (count)` to ensure we only count episodes belonging to each podcast
- Updated the data transformation to handle the new response structure where counts are in `episodes[0].count`

#### Verification Steps
1. Create multiple podcasts
2. Add episodes to different podcasts
3. Verify that each podcast shows the correct number of episodes in the admin table

  - Modified form initialization to correctly display existing publish dates
  - Updated form submission to convert dates to ISO format for database storage

#### Technical Decisions
- Used `toISOString().slice(0, 16)` to format dates for datetime-local input (YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm format)
- Created separate formData object to avoid mutating form state directly
- Converted dates back to full ISO format before database submission

#### Known Issues

  - Modified date display to show UTC dates in the form input
  - Updated form submission to properly convert local time to UTC
  - Used `Date.UTC()` to preserve intended time when converting to database format

#### Technical Decisions
- Used 'sv-SE' locale for consistent YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm format in datetime-local input
- Set `timeZone: 'UTC'` when displaying dates to ensure consistency with database
- Implemented proper UTC conversion during form submission to preserve intended time:
  ```javascript
  // Convert local time to UTC while preserving the intended time
  new Date(Date.UTC(
    localDate.getFullYear(),
    localDate.getMonth(),
    localDate.getDate(),
    localDate.getHours(),
    localDate.getMinutes()

### Twitter Card Integration Research (2025-02-05 08:34 PST)

#### Overview
Research conducted on implementing Twitter Player Cards for podcast episodes to enable sharing specific timestamps or clips.

#### Technical Options

1. **Basic Episode Card**:
   - Static player card with episode metadata
   - Direct link to specific timestamp
   - Simpler implementation but less interactive

2. **Interactive Player Card**:
   - Embedded player starting at specific timestamp
   - Episode artwork and player controls
   - More engaging but requires more development effort

#### Implementation Requirements

1. **Meta Tags Structure**:
```html
<meta name="twitter:card" content="player">
<meta name="twitter:site" content="@YourTwitterHandle">
<meta name="twitter:title" content="Episode Title">
<meta name="twitter:description" content="Episode description">
<meta name="twitter:player" content="https://your-domain.com/embed/episode-id?t=timestamp">
<meta name="twitter:player:width" content="480">
<meta name="twitter:player:height" content="480">
<meta name="twitter:image" content="https://your-domain.com/episode-thumbnail.jpg">
```

2. **Technical Requirements**:
   - Dedicated embed page for player
   - HTTPS serving
   - No plugin dependencies
   - Domain whitelisting with Twitter
   - Card validation and approval

#### TODO Items

1. **Phase 1: Basic Integration**
   - [ ] Create embed page component for player card
   - [ ] Add Twitter card meta tags to episode pages
   - [ ] Implement timestamp parameter handling in player
   - [ ] Add domain to Twitter's whitelist
   - [ ] Test with Twitter Card Validator

2. **Phase 2: Enhanced Features**
   - [ ] Add "Share on Twitter" button with timestamp
   - [ ] Create clip selection interface
   - [ ] Add preview of Twitter card before sharing
   - [ ] Implement analytics for shared timestamps

#### Known Limitations
- Twitter card approval required for player cards
- Image requirements: minimum 68,600 pixels (262x262 or 350x196)
- Maximum image size: 5MB
- Description limited to 200 characters

#### Next Steps
1. Decide between basic or interactive implementation
2. Set up HTTPS if not already configured
3. Begin with Phase 1 implementation tasks
4. Submit for Twitter card approval

```

### Development Server Configuration Fix (2025-02-10 14:31 PST)

#### Changes Made
1. Identified and fixed local development server configuration:
   - Added `NITRO_HOST` environment variable requirement

   - Validated authentication flow with localtest.me domain

#### Technical Implementation
- Set `NITRO_HOST=localhost.localtest.me` when starting dev server
- Confirmed working with Supabase authentication
- Proper cookie handling with custom domain

#### Technical Decisions
1. **Host Configuration**:
   - Using `NITRO_HOST` environment variable for explicit host setting
   - Maintains compatibility with Supabase auth requirements
   - Ensures consistent local development experience

2. **Domain Handling**:
   - `localtest.me` resolves to 127.0.0.1
   - Proper cookie domain configuration in nuxt.config.ts
   - Matches production-like environment

#### Known Issues
- Default `npm run dev` without `NITRO_HOST` won't work with authentication
- Must explicitly set host for proper auth flow

#### Next Steps
- Consider adding npm script for easier startup
- Document in team onboarding materials
- Verify configuration works across different development environments
